# Naive_Bayes_Classifier_for_Email_Classification

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier for classifying emails as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam." The Naive Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic algorithm that uses Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of independence between features. It is a popular choice for text classification tasks like email spam detection. [Check it out](Naive_Bayes_Classifier_for_Email_Classification)
